# Ender 3 Pro Configs
This repository contains various configuration files that I use for my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer.

Note that I am not using the stock Creality board but instead I'm using an SKR Mini E3 V1.2

## firmware_configs
This folder contains the configuration files for the Marlin firmware.

Each folder refers to a different version and/or configuration

## slicer_configs
This folder contains various configuration files that I use for slicing software.

The "PrusaSlicer_config_bundle.ini" file contains all my profiles for Prusa (printer, filament, ...) and it was generated on Prusa's version 2.4.0
